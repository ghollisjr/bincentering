Key: - Completed
     + Todo
     * General info
     % Inapplicable, though similar thoughts might be resolvable later
     c Currently

- Modify Makefile from maid_xsection example program

  - Change program and source file names.
  - Add more source code files and objects
  - Update the executable target recipe to allow new object files

- Look at the testIntegrationMultiDim() example from rootexample.cc to
  see how to implement multi-dimensional integration from a C
  function.  Can use this to create a bincentering corrections
  program.

- Implement histogram reading from file

- Implement bin specification reading from histograms, and generating
  empty histograms from bin specifications

- Create dsigma function which uses global variables and type casting
  to allow the proper function type for ROOT to be able to integrate

- Add averaging functions that use the integration functions

- Add verbose messaging abilities to integration over histograms

- Test libraries:

  -1. Test argument parsing
  -2. Test sampling

      UPDATE: sampling fails in bincentering, investigate
  -3. Test integration
  -4. Test averaging
  -5. Test histogram division
  
- Test integration:

  -1. Integration over a single bin

      Test seems to be OK, except for large W range I did get an NaN
      as the result of the integration, but for [1.1,1.2] W range I
      got a sensible answer.

  -2. Integration over Ye's histogram binning

- Program should support input from THnSparseD objects only, since
  there are far too many bins to integrate in the full histogram
  space.

% (POSSIBLY DEFUNCT, REEXAMINE LATER) Program should accept various
  kinds of input based on the input arguments, so I should include my
  argument parser library in the project.  Inputs to support:

  * Text input:
    + Bin edges
    + Min, max, delta
  * ROOT File input:
    + Binning from TH1, TH2, TH3, or THnSparse histogram.  Just
      provide path to root file and path within root file to the
      histogram
